# Landmark-Classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs-

## In this project, I applied the skills I acquired in the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) course to build a robust landmark classifier. The aim was to create a system capable of automatically predicting the location of an image based on discernible landmarks. This project is particularly relevant for photo sharing and storage services that rely on location data for features like automatic tagging and photo organization, especially when the image's metadata is unavailable.

## Data Preprocessing:

* I prepared and cleaned the dataset to ensure it was ready for training CNN models, addressing any inconsistencies and preparing the data for optimal performance.

## CNN Design and Training:
* I designed and trained multiple CNN architectures to classify landmarks effectively.
* By experimenting with various CNN models, I identified the most accurate and efficient one.

## Model Comparison:
* I compared the performance of different CNNs based on their accuracy in classifying landmarks, ensuring that the best model was selected.

## Deployment:
* I deployed an application based on the top-performing CNN, enabling it to predict the location of images based on the landmarks depicted.
